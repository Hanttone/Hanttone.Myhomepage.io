                    <p class = "thisisme"> Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Henna and I am a coder from Finland, currently living in Germany. My current interests lie in mainly Web Development and Software Development. The languages I am using are CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Python. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    I am self taught and have been coding/teaching myself since the beginning of February 2020. Beside coding when I have th time I enjoy hiking up in the beautiful Alps, which are right next door to where I live. When not out in nature (sweating) I enjoy my coffee breaks and reading a really good fantasy book. As a part time side thing I also enjoy photography and you can go and take a look at my nature pictures on <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/projecthappify/" target = "_blank">Instagram</a>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                If you got interested in what I can do, please take a look at my projects below. As of now I don´t have any finished projects to show, but be sure I will be uploading them as I get them finished (I have a couple I am really excited to get finished). Beside the coding experience in case you want to know more about my professional past (it is a colorful past), please feel free to take a look at my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/henna-anttonen-119303145/" target = "_blank">Linkedin</a>.</p>
